## Thermal Compound

I have been using thermal compound for over 30 years. I've used it for overclocking systems, as well as delidding, water-cooling, air-cooling, high-pressure, low-pressure, fanless systems, and I've seen it used in laptops. I've tested quite a number of brands over the years, from liquid metal to pastes.

The most desired quality in any thermal compound is to facilitate heat transfer between components without leaking, oozing, drying out, or introducing any other failure conditions. As such, I do not recommend any metal or electrically conductive pastes due to the possibility of damage due to stray drops/paste. Similarly, any that dry out over time would not be suggested, because as paste dries out, it loses thermal conductivity. Paste must be thick, in order to stay put over time; pastes that leak out of place also eventually fail to do their jobs.

### Application tip

There are a variety of methods of application, some favor a single larger dot in the center of the (CPU/GPU) die, some make an X, a %, four dots in the corners, etc. I prefer to apply a bit of paste to the die and then spread it evenly, as thinly as possible using a razor blade tipped to about 20-30 degrees and dragged back across the paste from multiple directions to ensure a super thin, even coverage. Beware of scraping the surface of the die, care must be taken to avoid that and only use a new/clean razor that has no damage to the edge.

### Recommended Choice

- [Arctic MX-4 Thermal Paste 8g size](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LF66ZSV)
  - [Large MX-4 20g size](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LDJY4X2)
- [Arctic MX-6 Thermal Paste 8g size](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VDLH5M6)

In my career, building and installing servers, I have tested quite a few various Thermal compounds/pastes over the years. I always recommend replacing any stock thermal paste with MX4. An 8g size should last through about a dozen CPU installations. Personally, I generally prefer buying it in the 20g size to make it more economical. I have opened systems that have been in service for over 8 years and found it still slightly moist and sufficiently tacky.

A more recent product is the MX-6, which is thicker and promises to be better for GPUs, Laptops, and potential delidding. So far, it has worked well, but it will take several years for it to replace MX-4 as my top suggestion. The increased versatility of it beyond only CPUs makes it a must-have item.

### Delidding

Should you delid? I have only done so a couple of times and found rather limited benefit to doing so. Does it reduce temps by a couple of degrees? Yes, generally it does. Is that 2-3 degrees worth the additional effort and risk of going for a delid? That's really up to you. Laptops and Intel CPUs are theoretically a lot easier than Ryzen chips, so I would probably avoid trying to delid a Ryzen.

### Other tested thermal compounds/pastes

- [Arctic Silver 5](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0087X728K)
  - In my experience, this paste dries out more than I like after a few years, but otherwise was one of the best for many years.
- Supermicro Paste
  - This is the paste that comes with Supermicro systems. It dries out dreadfully over time and is exceedingly thick paste. I often remove it and replace it with MX-4.
- Shuttle Paste
  - This is the paste the comes with Shuttle PCs. It is quite similar to Arctic Silver 5, if slightly thinner. Stays goopy fairly well over time.
